    'As an Pedagogy graduate, I noticed that parents and children need support in the field of nutrition. Nutrition is essential for a safe and healthy basis for everyone, which is the starting point for both emotional and physical growth. Based on this need and my own interest in nutrition, I am now a registered dietitian. From my own experience in the field of eating disorders, I assist people with an eating disorder using the ISA Power method.',

    'Help is offered to children, adolescents and adults with eating disorders such as anorexia, bulimia, binge eating disorder, OSFED (previously referred to as NAO). The latter concerns a combination of symptoms of one or more of the aforementioned eating disorders. You can also contact us for food problems. \n' +
    'During the coaching sessions we will hardly talk about food. I am convinced that an eating disorder is not about eating, but that an eating disorder is used as a coping mechanism. Finding out together how you use your eating disorder, and what your eating disorder means, and who you are without an eating disorder are some of the topics that we will go through together. We will discuss, among other things, self-confidence, gratitude, pride and happiness.\n',

    'An eating disorder is unfortunately not limited to one person. The family, relatives and friends also suffer from this disease. A coaching session for yourself, as a loved one, can provide insight into the disease, can help you deal with and answer questions. The ISA Power methods are used for coaching family members in eating disorders and eating problems. \n' +
