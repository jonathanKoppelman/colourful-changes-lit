    'As an Pedagogy graduate, I noticed that parents and children need support in the field of nutrition. Nutrition is essential for a safe and healthy basis for everyone, which is the starting point for both emotional and physical growth. Based on this need and my own interest in nutrition, I am now a registered dietitian. From my own experience in the field of eating disorders, I assist people with an eating disorder using the ISA Power method.',
